# Automatic installation

The easiest way to get irony-mode and its dependencies is to use
[el-get][el-get-ref].

    M-x el-get-install RET irony-mode RET

My [irony-mode configuration for el-get][init-irony-mode-ref] can help you get
started!

You are ready to go, you can jump to: [Usage](#usage)

[init-irony-mode-ref]: https://github.com/Sarcasm/.emacs.d/blob/master/sarcasm-elisp/sarcasm-packages/init-irony-mode.el "Irony-Mode initialization"


# Manual installation

## Download and build

Download with `git >= 1.6.5` and later:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode.git

Download with `git < 1.6.5`:

    git clone git://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode.git
    git submodule update --init

Finally:

    cd irony-mode
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake .. && make -j 4
    make install

*Note:* It is recommended to proceed to the installation step. This is not a
system-wide installation, it shouldn't require any privilege. The installation
step will help `irony.el` to find the binary without additional configuration.


## Elisp dependencies

Recommended packages and versions:

| Package                           | Version   | Status        | Comment                                                                                                 |

## Emacs configuration

Add irony-mode to the load `load-path`:

```el
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/IRONY/MODE/PATH/elisp/"))
```

And fill-in a basic configuration as shown below in
[Auto Complete](#auto-complete).


# Usage

If you want the completion to work on a project you will probably need give some
information about the flags necessary to compile a file. The best way to achieve
this is to use a [Compilation Database](#compilation-database). Otherwise you
can always use the customizable variables: `M-x customize-group RET irony RET`.

**Note:** If you want to force the reload of the flags on the server, you can
use the command `M-x irony-reload-flags`. This shouldn't be necessary if you use
the compilation database plugin.


# Plugins

To enable a plugin call `(irony-enable 'plugin-name)`. To enable more than one
plugin at once call the same function with a list `(irony-enable '(plugin-1
plugin-2))`.


## Auto Complete

Code completion with auto-complete.

Requires:

* [auto-complete][ac-ref]
* [yasnippet][yasnippet-ref] (optional)

Configuration:

```el
(require 'auto-complete)
(require 'yasnippet)
(require 'irony) ;Note: hit `C-c C-b' to open build menu

;; the ac plugin will be activated in each buffer using irony-mode
(irony-enable 'ac)             ; hit C-RET to trigger completion

(defun my-c++-hooks ()
  "Enable the hooks in the preferred order: 'yas -> auto-complete -> irony'."
  ;; if yas is not set before (auto-complete-mode 1), overlays may persist after
  ;; an expansion.
  (yas/minor-mode-on)
  (auto-complete-mode 1)

  ;; avoid enabling irony-mode in modes that inherits c-mode, e.g: php-mode
  (when (member major-mode irony-known-modes)
    (irony-mode 1)))

(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'my-c++-hooks)
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c++-hooks)
```

Please initialize your packages in the the following order unless you have a
reason not to:

1. `yas`
2. `ac`
3. `irony`

**Note:** If my fork of `auto-complete` is used you should be careful
to not have another installation of `auto-complete` or `popup` since
both of them are present in my fork.

You can eval these lines in the `*scratch*` buffer:

```el
(let ((requirements (or (require 'auto-complete nil t)
                        (require 'popup nil t))))
  (message "You should remove both auto-complete and popup before using my fork of auto-complete"))
```

Hit `C-x C-e` at the end of the expression to evaluate.


## Compilation Database

In order to work correctly, `irony-mode` needs to know the compile flags. This
plugin allow aims to provide *as automatic as possible* compile flags discovery,
with minimum user input.

It works great with the following tools:

- [CMake][cmake-ref] >= 2.8.5

- [Ninja][ninja-ref] >= 1.2 - Use `ninja -t compdb` to generate a compilation
  database for your project.

- [Bear][bear-ref] - Bear is a tool that can generate a
  `compile_commands.json` file by "monitoring" the build of a project.
  The typical usage for a `make` based project will be `bear -- make
  -B`.

- [.clang_complete][clang_complete-doc-ref] - A file at the root of your project
  containing the compilation flags, one per line. This is compatible with the
  with plugin [Rip-Rip/clang_complete][clang_complete-vim-ref]. If you want to
  generate the `.clang_complete` automatically, take a look there:
  [cc_args.py documentation][cc_args-py-doc-ref].


The [JSON Compilation Database Format Specification][clang-compile-db-ref] page
might reference some new tools in the future supporting the
`compile_commands.json` format (such as `cmake` and `Bear` described above).
`irony-mode` support that file format and hopefully it should work
*out-of-the-box* for such tool.

![Compilation DB demo](https://raw.github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode/develop/screenshots/cdb.gif)

Usage:

This is not really a plugin but something built-in irony-mode core, as such it
doesn't require any activation code. Just hit `C-c C-b` to display the build
configuration menu.

The menu should be self explanatory, if it's not the case open an issue please.

# FAQ


__It's slow, why?__

A bug in old version of Clang (at least '3.1-8') caused the completion to fail
on the standard library types. To eliminate this bug an optimisation has been
disabled in the parsing of a translation unit. This result in a slower parsing.

This only affect old versions of Clang (< 3.2), it is suggested to update your
libclang installation if you want to take advantage of the optimizations.

__How do I use a custom version of libclang?__

On a system with multiple versions of libclang installed, it is possible to
*hint* CMake in order to pick-up the preferred one. Two variables can be
specified when invoking CMake:

1. `LIBCLANG_INCLUDE_PATH=/path/to/libclang/include-dir`: The path to the
   include directory that contains the header file *clang-c/Index.h*.

2. `LIBCLANG_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libclang/libraries`: The path to the
   directory that contains the libclang library, e.g: *libclang.so* on Linux.

Example of a CMake invocation using a custom libclang installation:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DLIBCLANG_INCLUDE_PATH=~/llvm-3.4/include/ \
          -DLIBCLANG_LIBRARY_PATH=~/llvm-3.4/lib/ ..


__CMake doesn't find libclang...__

When libclang is installed in a non-standard path CMake may produce the
following error:

    CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:108 (message):
    Could NOT find LibClang (missing: LibClang_LIBRARY LibClang_INCLUDE_DIR)
    Call Stack (most recent call first):
    /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:315 (FPHSAFAILURE_MESSAGE)
    cmake/FindLibClang.cmake:35 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
    server/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package)

This can be fixed by using the same method as described above, using a custom
version of libclang.

Please report an issue if the include and library paths are the standard
libclang installation paths on your system. Other users may benefit from these
paths being handled *natively* by irony-mode.


__I got an error due to 'stdarg.h'...__

If by looking into the log file (`/tmp/irony.$$PID.log` on Linux) you
can have the following error:

    'stdarg.h' file not found

Assuming (otherwise it might be necessary to adjust the code):

* Clang version is 3.2
* Clang is installed in `/usr/`

You can use the following configuration:

```el
;; The Clang installation missed the system include directory
;; "/usr/lib/clang/3.2/include/"
(when (file-exists-p "/usr/lib/clang/3.2/include/")
  (setq irony-libclang-additional-flags
        '("-isystem" "/usr/lib/clang/3.2/include/")))
```

This is issue is a known problem:

* http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2012-July/022893.html

> Make sure that Clang is using its own <stddef.h>. It will be in a
> directory ending in `clang/3.2/include/` where 3.2 is the version of
> clang that you are using. You may need to explicitly add it to your
> header search. Usually clang finds this directory relative to the
> executable with CompilerInvocation::GetResourcesPath(Argv0,
> MainAddr), but using just the libraries, it can't automatically find
> it.


__libclang.so: cannot open shared object file...__

Compiling `irony-server` succeed but you have the following message
when you try to run the `irony-server` executable:

    'irony-server: error while loading shared libraries: libclang.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Maybe it's due to a non-standard location for your installation of
`libclang`. A path such as `/usr/local/lib` might not be in the path
list of the dynamic loader (see ld.so.conf).

To solve this issue it is possible to build `irony-server` with the
following command:

    cmake -DUSE_RPATH=ON ..


__auto-complete acts strangely, it tries to complete inside string literals...__

In order to enable header completion, such as:

```cpp
#include "heade[COMP]
```

The `ac` plugin allows `auto-complete` to complete inside string
literals in `irony-ac-enable`.

```el
(setq ac-disable-faces (delq 'font-lock-string-face ac-disable-faces))
```

Please create an issue if you find this unacceptable.
